# banditr

The goal of banditr is to manage multi-armed bandit experiments. The package supports Linear Upper Confidence Bound (LinUCB), and Thompson sampling algorithms. It allows storing the resulting objects in a database management system (DBMS). Currently, the package supports one DBMS: Microsoft SQL Server, through the [`RODBC`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RODBC/index.html) package.

## Installation

You can install banditr from github with:

```{r gh-installation, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("rferrali/banditr", build_vignettes = TRUE)
```

## Tutorial

A vignette provides a full-fledged tutorial to learn how to use the package. 

```{r example, eval = FALSE}
vignette("introduction", "banditr")
```
